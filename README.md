# Geckonator Dev Edition

This is a follow-up version og the [original Geckonator hardware][geckonator-hw] and is, similarly to the original, designed to help in early design work with the Silabs Happy Gecko family of USB microsontrollers.

This board, compared to the original, has two buttons (one to enter bootloader mode and one for power), a larger chip with more pins, all broken out, 3 LED's instead of 2, and a large prototyping area, where other stuff can be soldered on to for a semi permanent setup.

## Firmware

This board is designed for the development of the [Geckoboot bootloader][geckoboot], and for developing applications for this, the [Geckonator][geckonator] repository can be used as a base
